# Just-in-time tooling 

The people at RStudio, now [Posit](https://posit.co/)
, have given many gifts to the data community over the years.

When I struggled connecting scripts with data files and plots, the [RStudio IDE](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/) saved the day.

When I tired of manually pasting together monthly revenue reports for the leadership team, [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) took over to automate the process. Later this helped a start-up put daily A/B testing reports into production and a PR team scale press releases to engage global journalists with custom commentary.

And when I began teaching data courses on the side, RStudio Cloud - now [Posit Could](https://posit.cloud/) - saved countless hours of troubleshooting by giving my students pre-configured environments.

# And now this site

This static website, which is hosted at the moment for free on Github Pages, is built with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/).

Think of Quarto as the next generation of R Markdown with:

- Better styling
- More customizations
- Native python support (I spun up the site today using VS Code with python code chunks via Jupyter)

# Not only a user

Not only am I a Quarto convert, I'm also now part of the company that supports the project! 

It has been great to join an organization that has provided so many valuable open source data tools and resources during my career.
