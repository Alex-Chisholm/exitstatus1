    "text": "The people at RStudio, now Posit, have given many gifts to the data community over the years.\nWhen I struggled connecting scripts with data files and plots, the RStudio IDE saved the day.\nWhen I tired of manually pasting together monthly revenue reports for the leadership team, R Markdown took over to automate the process. Later this helped a start-up put daily A/B testing reports into production and a PR team scale press releases to engage global journalists with custom commentary.\nAnd when I began teaching data courses on the side, RStudio Cloud - now Posit Could - saved countless hours of troubleshooting by giving my students pre-configured environments."
