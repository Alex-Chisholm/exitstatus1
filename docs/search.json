Later this helped a start-up put daily A/B testing reports into production and a PR team scale press releases to engage global journalists with custom commentary.\nAnd when I began teaching data courses on the side, RStudio Cloud - now Posit Could - saved countless hours of troubleshooting by giving my students pre-configured environments.\n\n\nAnd now this site\nThis static website, which is hosted at the moment for free on Github Pages, is built with Quarto.\nThink of Quarto as the next generation of R Markdown with:\n\nBetter styling\nMore customizations\nNative python support (I spun up the site today using VS Code with python code chunks via Jupyter)\n\n\n\nNot only a user\nNot only am I a Quarto convert, Iâ€™m also now part of the company that supports the project!\nIt has been great to join an organization that has provided so many valuable open source data tools and resources during my career."
